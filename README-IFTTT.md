* In Blue Iris, open a camera's properties and go to the "Alerts" tab.
* Check "Request from a web service"
* Click "Configure" next to the "Request from a web service" line
* In the "When Triggered" section, select "https://" or "http://" based on your node-red setup and enter yourappname.mybluemix.net/red/ifttt
* Replace "yourappname" above with the name of your node-red app.
* pass command details by  populating "POST text"  same way as "maker channel body" example above.
* Click OK all the way out.
